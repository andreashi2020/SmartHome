# SmartHome: a Python Application developed for classifying SmartHome gestures. 
## It is used for training and testing a CNN model for hand gestures, and applying pre-trained machine learning model usage for classification. 

## Project Setup:
This project is developed by Python 3.8. Library needed:
1. TensorFlow 
2. OpenCV
3. Keras


To run this application on local machine, please make sure:
1. Test videos are saved under test folder
2. Training videos are saved under traindata folder
3. After run main.py, the gesture label number will be generated under the Results.csv file.
